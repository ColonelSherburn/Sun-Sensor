Gentlemen, 

After discussing with Chris and looking back over the original data I made a mistake by inadvertently 
scaling "sensor 3" by the wrong number on the first graph. I have corrected the issue and updated the 
slide deck. Kudos to Chris to finding the issue, I think he would make a really good detective given his 
attention to detail! 

Don and I will run some "glinting" test tomorrow to see if it's going to be an issue. 

Thanks again,
Dan

Subject: Updates Sun Sensor Test Slide Deck
All, 

I updated the slide deck for the sun sensor test. My original slides were misleading in that they gave the 
impression that the sun sensor assembly was flat during the test when it was actually mounted at a 45 
degree angle to mimic the way it is mounted on the NEA Scout. I've also included some backup slides 
with drawings and pictures of the test.

Chris, I have less than two weeks left so if there are any tests you would like us to run before I leave 
please let me know. You mentioned before looking at "glint", we should brainstorm some ways to run 
those tests. 

Thanks,
Dan
